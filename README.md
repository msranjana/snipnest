## 💻 Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm/yarn

### Environment Variables

For rate limiting in production, you'll need Upstash Redis:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Add your Upstash details ([Get them here](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted))

> Note: Don't worry about rate limiting on localhost or in development mode - it's off by default.

### Going Live

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```
