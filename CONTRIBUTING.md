# Contributing to SnipNest

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by and considering contributing to this project. Whether you're fixing bugs, improving the code, or adding cool new snippets, your help means a lot. Before diving in, let's go over a few things to keep everything smooth and consistent.

## What We're Looking For

- Share a better way to write something.
- Fixing bugs is always appreciated and makes a big difference.
- Submitting useful snippet ideas helps the entire community.

The only thing we ask is that you follow the rules below to keep everything tidy and easy to work with.

## Snippet Guidelines

### Folder Structure

Snippets live in this structure:

```
snippets/language/category/snippet.mdx
```

Here's how it breaks down:

- **`language`**: Lowercase only. For example:
  - `JavaScript` -> `javascript`
  - `c++` → `cpp`
  - `c#` → `cs`
- **`category` and `snippet`**: Use [kebab-case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case). For example: `lorem-ipsum`.

### File Type

Every snippet must be a `.mdx` file.

### What Goes Inside

Each snippet file needs two things: **metadata** and **code blocks**.

#### 1. Metadata

At the very top of the file, include this export with the same order of properties:

```javascript
export const metadata = {
  name: "Name of the snippet", // Short and clear
  description: "What the snippet does in a sentence or two", // Describe what the snippet does, clearly and concisely
  keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"], // Add at least the category name in the array, please keep it short and clear and use kebab-case, within a reasonable amount
  contributors: ["your-username"], // Everyone who helped/contributed, as GitHub usernames
};
```

#### 2. Code Blocks

Your snippet must have **two code blocks**:

1. **Snippet**: This is the actual code. Make sure to annotate it with the language for syntax highlighting, please use the ID or alias of the language found in the [supported languages](https://shiki.style/languages) list.

   Example:

   ````markdown
   ```js
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```
   ````

2. **Example**: Show how the snippet works with an example.

   Example:

   ````markdown
   ```js
   add(2, 3); // 5
   ```
   ````

### What doesn't go inside

### Important Notes

- **No Duplicates**: Don't submit a snippet that does something the language already has built-in.
- **Stick to the Rules**: Use the proper casing and formats for folder and file names.
- **Only Metadata and Code**: Don't add any markdown related content other than the metadata and code blocks.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

If you're planning on submitting a snippet for TypeScript, please check if it already exists for JavaScript. If it does, only submit it if it has major differences, e.g., generics, type annotations. For example, adding a TypeScript equivalent for [To Kebab Case](https://snipnest.dev/javascript/string/to-kebab-case) isn't needed as the only difference is the function parameter type.

If you're unsure whether you should submit such a snippet, submit it anyway and we'll check it out.

## How to Contribute

### Adding a Snippet

1. Find the right folder for the language and category. If it doesn't exist, create it (refer to [Adding Languages or Categories](#adding-languages-or-categories)).
2. Add a new `.mdx` file for your snippet.
3. Follow the format we outlined above.
4. Submit your work via a pull request (refer to [Submitting Your Work](#submitting-your-work)).

### Editing a Snippet

1. Open the file you want to tweak.
2. Make your changes while keeping the format intact.
3. Submit a pull request (refer to [Submitting Your Work](#submitting-your-work)).

## Adding Languages or Categories

### New Language

1. Create a new folder in `snippets/` with the language name in lowercase.
   - For example: `javascript`, `python`, `cpp`.
2. Add categories and snippets as needed.
3. Update the list of languages in `lib/constants.tsx`. (optional)

### New Category

1. Go to the language folder.
2. Create a new folder for the category in kebab-case.
   - For example: `data-structures`, `file-handling`.
3. Add your snippets inside.

## Submitting Your Work

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch for your changes.
2. Make sure your snippet follows all the rules.
3. Write a clear and descriptive pull request title.
4. Add an explanation of your changes.
5. Be ready to respond to feedback during the review.
